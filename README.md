PyGitUp
=========

PyGitUp is a Python implementation of the great [aanand/git-up/](https://github.com/aanand/git-up/).
*(more README will come soom)*

Why using `git up`?
-------------------
> git pull has two problems:
> * It merges upstream changes by default, when it's really more polite to rebase over them, unless your collaborators enjoy a commit graph that looks like bedhead.
> * It only updates the branch you're currently on, which means git push will shout at you for being behind on branches you don't particularly care about right now.

Alpha, not well tested. You can expect a lot of bugs.
